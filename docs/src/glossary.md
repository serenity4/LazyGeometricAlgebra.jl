# Glossary

**Geometric algebra**: Mathematical framework based around the geometric product, relying on an [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra) to construct entities of geometric significance.

**Geometric space**: Mathematical space defined with objects and a geometric product satisfying the axioms of geometric algebra, with a defined signature.

**Signature**: Parameter of a geometric space determining the scalar value of the square of its basis vectors under the geometric product.
