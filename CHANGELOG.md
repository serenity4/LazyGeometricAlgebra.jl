# Changelog

## v0.2

- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] `*` no longer aliases the geometric product by default `âŸ‘` (`\wedgedot`).
- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] `VariableInfo` has been renamed `Bindings` for better clarity.
- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] The `flattening` symbol parameter to `@ga` has been removed, instead using type annotations to express a concatenated or tuple output.
- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] The `::KVector{$k}` type annotation is no longer supported; instead, prefer using `::$k` or (if `k` is small enough) one of its aliases, e.g. `Bivector` for `KVector{2}`. The `::Multivector{$k, $l, ...}` syntax is also no longer supported; use the `::($k, $l, ...)` syntax instead.
- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] Default bindings are no longer merged into provided bindings in `codegen_expression`.
- ![feature][badge-feature] A new macro `@geometric_space` has been defined to ease the definition of user macros. See the documentation for more information.
